# Will's Mod 1 Project

This is my first project here at Flatiron.

## Installation

This project can be found at[https://github.com/Will-Gon/ruby-project-guidelines-sfo01-seng-ft-082420]

Fork and clone it in your own repo to play around with it if you would like.


## Usage

```Ruby

Here is a very simple Cli app that takes a construction company and keeps track of the clients it has and the project they have through those clients. You can run this by running 'ruby bin/run.rb' in your terminal!

First you are welcome with a greeting, and with a request for your name. If you are one of the clients it will take you to a client menu. If you are not yet a client, you will be asked to input some information and you will be added to the apps database.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
